## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn package manager
- Google account (for Google Sheets and Apps Script)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd intern-time-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Google Sheets Backend:**
   - Configure the API URL in `.env` file

4. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the environment template
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your Google Apps Script URL
   VITE_TIME_TRACKER_API="your-google-apps-script-url"
   ```
5. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the application:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
   - The application will be ready to use with Google Sheets integration

## Google Sheets Integration

This application uses Google Sheets as its database through Google Apps Script. 

### üö® IMPORTANT: CORS Error Fix

If you're experiencing CORS errors or the check-in/check-out functionality is not working, you need to deploy the corrected Google Apps Script. **[üìã Follow the complete deployment guide here](./GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_DEPLOYMENT.md)**

### Quick Setup:
1. **Deploy the Google Apps Script** using code from `FINAL_CORRECTED_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.js` (‚ö†Ô∏è **Most Important Step**)
2. Configure your Google Sheets with the required structure  
3. Update the `.env` file with your Apps Script URL
4. The application will automatically connect to your Google Sheets

### Admin Access:
- Default admin credentials: `admin` / `admin123`
- Additional admin users can be created through the admin panel
- All admin data is stored securely in Google Sheets
   ```bash
   # Connect to MongoDB and create admin user
   mongosh mongodb://localhost:27017/intern-time-tracker
   
   db.admincredentials.insertOne({
     firstName: "Admin",
     lastName: "User", 
     employeeId: "ADMIN001",
     username: "admin",
     password: "admin123",
     role: "admin",
     createdAt: new Date()
   })
   ```

7. **Access the application:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000/api/health
   - Login with username: `admin`, password: `admin123`
